# Smart Contract Management Project: Function Frontend

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Ethereum smart contracts with a React frontend to manage and display academic records on the blockchain. The project includes a simple smart contract `AcademicRecords` written in Solidity and a React application that interacts with the contract.

## Features

- **Smart Contract (`AcademicRecords.sol`)**:
  - Manages academic records with functions to register learners and fetch their information.
  - Stores learner data such as name, grade, pass status, and subject.

- **Frontend Application (`React`)**:
  - Allows users to register new learners with their academic details.
  - Fetches and displays registered learner information from the blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Truffle Framework
- Ganache (or Ganache CLI)
- MetaMask browser extension

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-management.git
   cd smart-contract-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Ganache:**

   Start Ganache and ensure it is running on `http://localhost:8545` or update `truffle-config.js` if using a different port.

4. **Compile and migrate the smart contract:**

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```

5. **Copy contract artifacts:**

   Copy `AcademicRecords.json` from `build/contracts` to `src/contracts` in your React project directory.

6. **Start the React application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Connect MetaMask:**

   - Connect MetaMask to the local blockchain (Ganache) network (`Custom RPC` with URL `http://localhost:8545`).

8. **Interact with the application:**

   - Use the provided UI to register learners and fetch their details.

## Notes

- Ensure MetaMask is unlocked and connected to the local Ganache network to interact with the smart contract.
- Modify the `truffle-config.js` and React components as necessary for your specific setup.
